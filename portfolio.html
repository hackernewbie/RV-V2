										<i>"I owned a blog since 2014 but was not happy with its look, feel and navigation. I tried reaching out to several web developers none of whom gave me satisfactory reply or understood my vision of a blog. A casual chat in 2016 with Rajiv led to him working on my blog. I was surprised when he delivered exactly the same features on my blog as per my guidelines. It’s not very often that a client gets exactly the same product/service as envisioned by him. Since then, I have recommended Rajiv to many clients who themselves have been satisfied with his work. I am also a fan of the speed at which he delivers projects. His work speaks for itself and I don’t need to elaborate much."</i><br/>
